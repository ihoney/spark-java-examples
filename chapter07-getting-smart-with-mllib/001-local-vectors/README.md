==================

# Application Specs
+ Create two Spark dense vectors and a Spark sparse vector with contents [5.0, 6.0, 7.0, 8.0]
+ Obtain the size of the first vector
+ Access the third element of the second dense vector
+ Print all the elements of the sparse vector   

# Concepts
+ Create sparse and dense vectors using `Vectors` factory methods.
+ Use basic `Vector` methods such as: `toDense`, `toSparse`, `size` and `toArray`.
