==================

# Application Specs
+ Create the following matrix:
    M = [ 5 0 1
          0 3 4 ]
   
+ Create a 4x4 Identity matrix

+ Create a 4x2 ones matrix

+ create a 2x4 zeros matrix

+ create a diagonal matrix whose diagonal is represented by the vector [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

+ create a 10x10 random matrix using both the uniform distribution and the Gaussian distribution

+ create a sparse matrix using the CSC format, convert it to a dense matrix

+ create a sparse matrix from the dense matrix created in the first step

# Concepts
Illustrates how to create dense matrices using `Matrices.dense`.
It also illustrates how to create identity and diagonal matrices and matrices of zeros and ones.
It demonstrates how to create random matrices.
SparseMatrices are created using CSC format, and it is also demonstrated how to convert from dense to sparse and vice versa.
