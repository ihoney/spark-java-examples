=========================================

# Application Specs
Based on `007-adding-higher-order-polynomials`, create support functions that let you iterate over different numbers of iterations and step sizes but using `LassoWithSGD` and `RidgeRegressionWithSGD` algorithms instead of `LinearRegressionWithSGD`. To train and test the models use the dataset that included higher-order polynomials.


# Concepts
Using the `LassoWithSGD` and `RidgeRegressionWithSGD` models with different number of iterations, step sizes and regularization parameter values.
