007-adding-higher-order-polynomials
===================================

# Application Specs
Based on `004-housing-linear-regression`, modify the dataset so that it includes higher-order polynomials by creating a features vector that includes the original feature x and its square x^2.
Then, iterate over several number of iterations and step sizes to find the combination with fewer number of iterations that gives the best RMSE. 
   

# Concepts
Simulate non-linear regression by adding the squares of original features. No new Spark concept.
