==================

# Application Specs
Based on `008-regularization-lasso-ridge-regression`, create a support function that let you iterate over different numbers of iterations and step sizes and batch fractions using the Mini-batch Stochastic Gradient Descent model algorithm. To train and test the models use the dataset that included higher-order polynomials.


# Concepts
