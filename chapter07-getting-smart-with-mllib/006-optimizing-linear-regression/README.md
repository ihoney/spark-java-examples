006-optimizing-linear-regression
================================

# Application Specs
Using the dataset at https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Housing create a supporting function that lets you iterate over the number of iterations and step size of the algorithm that creates the model, so that you can choose the one that gives you the best RMSE of the testing dataset.
   

# Concepts
Nothing new, just builds on the previous project `004-housing-linear-regression` to automate the model creation and regression metrics computation.
