010-lbfgs-optimizer
===================

# Application Specs
Based on `009-mini-batch-sgd`, create a support function that let you iterate over different numbers of regularization parameters for a fixed number of corrections and toleranse using the LBFGS model algorithm. To train and test the models use the dataset that included higher-order polynomials.


# Concepts
Using the limited-memory approximation of the Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (LBFGS) algorithm for minimizing multidimensional functions.
