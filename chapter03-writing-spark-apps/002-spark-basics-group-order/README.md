#002-spark-basics-group-order


## Application Specs
Based on the functionality of `001-spark-basics`, this program performs a groupBy operation to create a map of {user, count}. Then orders the resulting map in ascending order.

## Concepts
It is illustrated how to perform `groupBy` and `orderBy` operations on `DataFrames`. It also includes a custom implementation of the function expected for `DataFrame.foreach`.

## Notes
It is intended to be used in a local Spark installation.
